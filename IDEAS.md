- Above ground startpoint, underground gameplay
- Voxels
- Walljump
- Doublejump
- Volumetric fog
- Deathloop-like time reverse [this might be very hard to pull off]
- Pick a spot above map, fall, and whever your land when the round starts is where your spawnpoint is
- Camera tilt being kept
- Portal gun that works a few times a round and portals only stay open for 5 seconds once both ends open up

## xokz
- Grappling hook
- No surface return

# MrGlockenspiel
- Sliding
- Procedurally generated map [likely not going to happen because OH GOD NO]
